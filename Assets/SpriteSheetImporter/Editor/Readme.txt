# Flash Sprite Sheet Importer #

This tool allows to easily import and slice sprite sheets generated by Adobe Animate (Flash).

Adobe Animate Instructions
• Each sprite sheet can contain one or more movieclips.
• Export sprite sheets with their corresponding XML files (describing the location of all sprites).
• The Starling XML format now adds the possibility to use pivots from original movieclips.

Unity Instructions
• Get importer window by opening: Window -> Sprite Sheet Importer
• Then select a 2D Texture sprite sheet (alongside accompanying XML file).
• The Force Overwrite Pivot checkbox:
    – Shows a pull down menu to manually select a pivot position.
    – Can be used to ignore existing pivot data from the XML file.
• The Generate Animation checkbox:
    – Creates an Animator for the sprite sheet.
    – Also creates Animations for each animation movieclip.
    – Shows a field to choose frames per second for those Animations.
    – Shows a Generate GameObject checkbox which can be used to create a GameObject with the Animator.
    – Warning: This function can overwrite previously generated elements without notice.
• Finally, press 'Import Sprites'.
